# Logistic Regression Analysis on Hearing Test Data

This project involves conducting logistic regression analysis on a dataset containing information about hearing test results.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- age: The age of the individual undergoing the hearing test.
- physical_score: A measure of the individual's physical health.
- test_result: The outcome of the hearing test (e.g., 'pass' or 'fail').

## Analysis Objective

The objective of the analysis is to model the probability of passing or failing the hearing test based on the available features.

## Methodology

Logistic regression analysis was performed using the provided dataset. Logistic regression is a statistical method used for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, we aimed to predict the likelihood of passing or failing the hearing test based on the individual's age, physical health score, and other relevant factors.

## Results

The logistic regression analysis revealed the following insights:

- Age and physical health score were found to be significant predictors of hearing test outcomes.
- Individuals with higher physical health scores were more likely to pass the hearing test.
- The effect of age on hearing test outcomes varied, with older individuals having a higher likelihood of failing the test.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, age and physical health appear to be important factors influencing hearing test results. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that may contribute to hearing impairment and can inform future research and interventions aimed at improving hearing health outcomes.
